* Add Features
    * SNOT (studs not on top) functionality
    * Add 'exclusion' functionality so that one model doesnâ€™t create bricks where another model already did
    * Generate model with bricks and slopes to more closely approximate original mesh (USER REQUESTED)
    * Add customization for custom object offset, size, and brick scale (amount of bricksDict locations it takes up), default to scale/offset for 1x1 brick with stud
    * Add more brick types
    * Improve brick topology for 3D printing
    * Use shader-based bevel as opposed to geometry-based bevel
    * When switching to Bricker v1.7, update the following properties to be of subtype 'percentage' (and update values from outdated versions of Bricker):
        * cm.gap
        * cm.logoScale
        * cm.logoInset
    * improve intelligence of `getFirstImgTexNodes` function
        * choose prominent textures
        * ignore normal/bump textures
    * improve speed of `getFirstNode` function
        * store first nodes of materials so it doesn't have to recalculate every time
    * Custom UV unwrapper designed specifically for LEGO bricks
    * Improve model connectivity
        * Store each brick parent as a BMVert, with vert.co being the dictLoc
        * connect each BMVert with an edge if the two bricks are connected
    * (EASY) New animation types (loop, boomerang, etc)
        * this would be implemented in the `handle_animation` function
* Fixes
    * when brickified model's parent is rotated, bricks drawn by customizing model are often not rotated correctly
